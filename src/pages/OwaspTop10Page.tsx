                  The AI Vulnerability Scoring System (AIVSS) v0.5 is specifically designed to assess the severity of 
                  security risks in Agentic AI systems. Unlike traditional CVSS scoring, AIVSS incorporates unique factors 
                  relevant to autonomous AI agents, including agentic characteristics, societal impact, and cascading effects.
